Arrays and Dynamic Arrays
  1. Techniques used to solve problems
     1. Brute Force
     2. Two pointer 
     3. Sliding Window
     4. Binary Search
     5. Sort with Two pointer approach
     6. Using Map
     7. Using min and max
     8. Use different logic or algorithms(make them yourself)
     9. Use Boyer Moore's Majority Voting Algorithm(for optimization)
     10. Make some logical changes to already done code via 
     11. Bit manipulation
     12. Kidane's algorithm(currSum & maxSum)
->For union of arrays - Use Set DS
->For shift by k use
   ->basic approach
   ->Modulus
   ->reverse function
