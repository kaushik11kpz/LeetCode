-- For Traveral of Graph
1. Depth First Search(DFS) 
-We choose to move in a specific direction until we reach to end, from there we have to choose another direction
-Uses Stack
2. Breadth First Search 
-It tends to explore all direction evenly, intead of favouring one direction all the way through
-Uses Queue
3.Topological Sort
-Topological Sorting means a job(vertice) is executed first before its dependencies are executed
-Edges represent dependencies
-For printing relation it is used with Stack and dfs or bfs
-For other problems, it is used with indegree and queue with bfs
