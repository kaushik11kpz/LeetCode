Minimum Spanning Tree
-It is defined for a weighted and connected undirected graph
-A spanning tree is a tree, so no cycle and should be connected to all the vertices directly or undirectly
-for V vertices, V-1 edges is required for spanning tree
-It is defined for an unweighted graph
-For a weighted graph, we need to consider all spanning trees, we need to consider their weight, then we need to find minmum weight 
among them

To solve Minimum Spanning Tree
1. Naive Algorithm(Brute force)
-For a weighted graph, we need to consider all spanning trees, we need to consider their weight, then we need to find minmum weight 
among them
2. Prim's algorithm
-It is used to solve Minimum Spanning Tree problem
-It is a greedy algorithm
-It contains two sets
 1. Present in Minimum Spanning Tree(MST)
 2. Yet to be in MST
-We pick a Vertice and find the edge which has minimum weight to connect to other vertice(greedy approach)
-This Process goes on until no edge is left in second set
-Thus, Minimum Spanning Tree is obtained
