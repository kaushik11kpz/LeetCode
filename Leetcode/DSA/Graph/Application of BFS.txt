-> BFS is a graph traversal algo that takes a source traverses all the vertices that are just one edge away then all the vertices 
which are two edges away.
-> Advantage
Always finds the shortest path from a source to all vertices.


1. Shortest Path in an Unweighted Graph.
It finds the shortest path in unweighted graph.
For weighted graph
-> Dijkstra's Algo - based on BFS
   Difference is instead of using normal queue, Dijkstra's uses priority queue and weights of edges to find shortest path.
2. Crawler in search engine - Ex- In web, goes from one document to adjacent document to adjacent document.
3. Peer to Peer Networks- Bit torrent.
4. Social Networking Search - First friends come then adjacent of friends i.e Mutual friends than adjacents of friends of friends
5. Garbage Collection - Which memory location currently not reached by program, thus delete that memory.
6. Cycle Detection
7. Ford Fulkerson Algorithm - Maximum flow algorithm, better for BFS.
8. Broadcasting
