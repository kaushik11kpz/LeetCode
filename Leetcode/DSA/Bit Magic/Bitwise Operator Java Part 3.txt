6 a. Right Shift Operator/Signed Right Shift for Positive Number
-Oppose of left shift
-It fills leading bit with 0
-For x = 33,
  -> x>>1 ----> remove trailing bit by 1, right shift the remaining bit, add 1 leading 0 bit
  -> x>>2 ----> remove trailing bit by 2, right shift the remaining bit, add 2 leading 0 bit
  -> x>>3 ----> remove trailing bit by 3, right shift the remaining bit, add 3 leading 0 bit

-For negative number, it is known as
b. Signed Right Shift Operator for negative number
- It fills leading bit with 1 to keep the sign
- For x = -2,
  -> x>>1 ----> remove trailing bit by 1, right shift the remaining bit, add 1 leading 1 bit
  -> x>>2 ----> remove trailing bit by 2, right shift the remaining bit, add 2 leading 1 bit
  -> x>>3 ----> remove trailing bit by 3, right shift the remaining bit, add 3 leading 1 bit

-> 11......1111 - 2^32-1 , output = -1
-> 11......1110 - 2^32-2 , output = -2
-> 11......1100 - 2^32-3 , output = -3

7 a. Unsigned Right Shift Operator for Positive Number

b. Unsigned Right Shift Operator for Negative Number
-It fills leading bits with 0
