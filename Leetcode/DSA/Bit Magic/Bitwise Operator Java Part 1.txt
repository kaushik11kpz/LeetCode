1. Bitwise AND(&)
-Java represent Binary digits as 32 bit
-If both bits are 1 then Bitwise AND is 1
-If any bit is not 1, then Bitwise AND is 0

2. Biwise OR(|)
-If any of bit is 1, Bitwise OR is 1
-If both bits are 0, Bitwise OR is -

3. Bitwise XOR(^)
-Output is 1, when two input bits are different
-Output is 0, when both input bits are same
