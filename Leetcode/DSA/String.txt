Specific functions available
== references are compared.
.equals - checks content.
.compareTo - compares lexicographically.
 String class - Immutable - thread safety not required
 Mutable Classses
 StringBuffer - Thread Safe
 StringBuilder - to write program in single thread

TO SOLVE
   1. Use individual characters as indexes in order to mark the count
   2. Use HashMap or counting sort to count frequency of occurence of characters
   3. Use array of 26 letters with indiviual characters as occurences
   4. Use count and additional string variable for normal slovin purposes.

-> If set data structure is used for storage- space complexity - O(1)
   sice string is only 256, set size is 256.

Sliding Window Algorithm
1. Two pointers, both at start, moving according to given solution.

Important question 
  1. Longest string without repeating character.
