  Dynamic Programming
  1. An optimization over plain recursion
  2. The idea is to reuse the solutions of subproblems 
     when there are overlapping subproblems
 
 Two ways to implement DP
 1. Memoization(Top down)
 2. Tabulation(Bottom up)

 -> Memoization reduces the time complexity from exponential
  to linear.
