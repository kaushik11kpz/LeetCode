1. Initialize a variable to store all intermediary results of computed subproblems
int[] dp = new int[nums.length + 1]

2. Store the result of the "base case" or the simplest subproblem in your dp array
dp[0] = 1

3. Compute the result of all intermediary subproblems by performing ~magic~ ðŸª„

4. Return the result of the largest subproblem you solved
return dp[nums.length]
