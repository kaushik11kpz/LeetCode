-> push(), pop(), isEmpty() and peek() all take O(1) time. We do not run any loop in any of these operations
In Java
-> Operations on stack
1. Push
2. Pop
3. isEmpty
4. Search
5. Peek
  
-> Average or amortized time complexity O(1) in case of arraylist implementation of stack.
-> worst case time complexity O(1) in case of array implementation of stack.
-> For linked list, worst cas O(1).

In java
 Stack and ArrayDeque class implement stack, ArrayDeque is preffered.
 In single thread environment,use ArrayDeque
 Vector class is a thread safe class which causes extra overhead as stack class inherit from it.

Use two stack to solve many problems.
You can also use just one stack for efficient solution.
