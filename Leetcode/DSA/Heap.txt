Binary heap 
->Used to implement heap Sort algorithm
->Used to implement Priority Queue.


A binary heap is a complete binary tree
It is a complete binary tree so it can be represented in array format
Two types of heap data structure
1. Max Heap
2. Min Heap


->It is abinary tree data structure which can be represented as array without wasting any space
and having proper left, right, parent relationships.
->The multiple advantages of binary heap data structure are-
1. Items at contigous location, thus random access.
2. Cache friendly, loclity of reference
3. Complete binary tree, so height of tree is minimum possible.

->Min heap
1. It is a complete binary tree.
2. Every node has value smaller than its descendants.
3. Internally represented as an array.

 
Priority Queue is useful in standard algorithms like 
- Dijkstra's sortest path algorithm.
- Prims minimum spanning tree algorithm
- Huffman Coding
It is used where items are in a queue and each item in queue has specific priority.
