-It is a computational technique used to reduce the nested loop O(n^2) and replace it with a single loop O(n)

-Working
-A window of fix size k is used from starting of data structure and relevant info is computed
-Then, window moves to k for furthur computation
-This goes on until we reach at the end of data structure
 
-Utilization
1. Maximum sum of consecutive k elements
2. Maximum/Minimum k-subarray
3. XOR
4. Product
5. Sum
